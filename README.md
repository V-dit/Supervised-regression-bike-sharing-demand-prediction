# bike-sharing-demand-prediction
Predicting the demand of bike sharing from the data availalbe.\
This is a Capstone Project of Machine Learning (Regression Problem) undertaken as a course submission for the curricullum of [Full Stack Data Science](https://www.almabetter.com/courses/full-stack-data-science) with AlmaBetter.
A bike sharing dataset was used to forecast the demand of bike sharing. The exercise is classified under supervised machine learning problems. Python libraries like numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn (sklearn) were used. Regression analysis was the prime method used for the prediction. Concepts like MinMaxScaler, One Hot Encoding, Linear Regression, Ridge and Lasso regression, decision tree, random forest method, gridsearchcv and gradient boosting were used. The model performance was determined using parameters like r2 score, mean squared error, accuracy score and log loss.
